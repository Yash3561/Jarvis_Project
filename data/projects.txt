PROJECT: Explainable Multivariate Time Series Transformer for Solar Flare Prediction
ROLE: Lead Developer / Researcher
KEYWORDS: Transformer, Time Series, XAI, SHAP, LIME, PDP, Interpretability, PyTorch
ACTIONS:
- Led the end-to-end development of an MTST (Multivariate Time Series Transformer) model.
- My primary contribution was pioneering the use of XAI techniques like SHAP and LIME to make the "black box" transformer model interpretable.
- I engineered features and performed rigorous evaluation to enhance model performance.
METRICS_AND_RESULTS:
- Achieved over 90% accuracy on key metrics like TSS, AUC, and Recall.
- The work is significant enough that it is currently under review for publication in a top-tier conference.

PROJECT: Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning
KEYWORDS: Computer Vision, Deep Learning, VGG16, Flask, FastAPI, REST API, React, Healthcare AI
ACTIONS:
- I built the core of the system using a VGG16-based CNN model, fine-tuned on augmented brain scan datasets.
- I was responsible for deploying the trained model as a REST API using Flask and FastAPI, making it accessible to a web front-end.
- I also created the user-friendly React web application for doctors to upload and analyze the scans.
METRICS_AND_RESULTS:
- The model achieved a very high 99% test accuracy.
- This project demonstrates my full-stack capabilities: from model creation to deployment and front-end integration.

PROJECT: Hand Sign Language Detection to Audio
KEYWORDS: Computer Vision, Real-Time, OpenCV, MediaPipe
ACTIONS:
- I built a computer vision pipeline from scratch using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- The system captures video, processes it in real-time to identify 10 different hand signs, and provides an output.
- I thoroughly documented the entire pipeline to ensure the project was reproducible.
METRICS_AND_RESULTS:
- Achieved over 90% accuracy for recognizing the 10 signs.
- This project highlights my ability to build and document robust, real-time AI applications.

PROJECT: Cryptocurrency Price Movement Prediction
KEYWORDS: Machine Learning, Random Forest, Feature Engineering, Tableau
ACTIONS:
- I developed a Random Forest model to tackle the challenge of predicting Bitcoin price trends.
- I engineered features based on financial indicators like MACD and log-volumes to feed into the model.
- I used Tableau to create visualizations and dashboards to present the trends and insights.
METRICS_AND_RESULTS:
- Achieved a ROC AUC of 0.55, which is notable in a highly volatile and random market.
- Delivered actionable insights for potential investment strategies.

WORK_EXPERIENCE: Mobile Application Developer Intern at Toshal Infotech
KEYWORDS: Python, SQL, Data Integration, Optimization, Efficiency
ACTIONS:

- I focused on optimizing existing workflows.
METRICS_AND_RESULTS:
- My optimizations increased workflow efficiency by 15%.
- I consistently delivered applications 20% ahead of schedule, demonstrating strong time management.

WORK_EXPERIENCE: Android Developer Intern at Octacore Technologies
KEYWORDS: API Optimization, Performance, A/B Testing, User Engagement
ACTIONS:
- My main task was to improve the performance of an existing Android application by focusing on API calls.
- I implemented A/B testing frameworks to measure the impact of my changes on user behavior.
METRICS_AND_RESULTS:
- I successfully reduced the application's response time by 41% (from 1.2s down to 0.7s).
- My A/B tests showed that these performance improvements led to a 20% increase in user engagement.
